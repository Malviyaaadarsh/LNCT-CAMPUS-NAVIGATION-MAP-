# LNCT-CAMPUS-NAVIGATION-MAP-
 This Project is done for the Problem Statement : "To implement a navigation graph for our college campus (LNCT) using concepts of Graph theory . This project calculates the shortest path  between any two blocks of college campus using the Dijkstra Algorithm and with the help of python libraries .  

 
About the Project :    This project is implementing a graph with nodes(campus blocks  and buildings )and edges (distance between them which are taken approximately ) .
The plotting of the graph and the mapping of nodes is done manually with coordinates . Graph and Data Visualization is done with the help of networkx and matplot libraries ,which also include representation and visualization of mappings in  table form . The User can input Start and End Positions with the help of point sliders created with the help of widget library to interact with .
